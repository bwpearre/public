Each mode has a unitless desirability. Here's the calculator that turns those into probabilities that each mode is the best option—for the "average" over all trips.|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|Overlap: When a new mode is introduced (scooters), I need to make sure that, if scooters are essentially the same as bikes (high overlap, like bikes and morebikes), they don't result in a doubling of µmobility use. If they are completely different (no overlap), then they should. See the calculator for "bike-scooter overlap", right.|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|"choice temperature" is roughly anaologous to that in a classic softmax, although the math is different. High temperature makes desirability differences between the modes matter less in their choice—more randomness. Lower temperature increases preference for the more desirable mode.
