Each mode has a unitless desirability. Here's the calculator that turns those into probabilities that each mode is the best option for the "average" over all trips.|<<NnN>>||<<NnN>>|When a new mode is introduced (scooters), I need to make sure that, if scooters are essentially the same as bikes, they don't result in a doubling of µmobility use. If they are completely different, then they should. See the calculator for "bike-scooter overlap", right.
